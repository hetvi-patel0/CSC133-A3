# CSC133-A3

The purpose of this assignment is to help you gain experience with interactive graphics and animation techniques such as repainting, timer-driven animation, collision detection, and object selection. Specifically, you are to make the following modifications to your game:
(1) the game world map is to display in the GUI (in addition to the text form on the console),
(2) the movement (animation) of game objects is to be driven by a timer,
(3) the game is to support dynamic collision detection and response,
(4) the game is to support simple interactive editing of some of the objects in the world, and
(5) the game is to include sounds appropriate to collisions and other events.
